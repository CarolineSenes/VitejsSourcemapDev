# Sourcemap in dev mode

Sourcemap in dev mode is only displayed when there is an error in the console 
(i'm not talking about the CSS sourcemap). 
When you click on the file that contains the error, the sourcemap opens.



As you can see below, I am handling an error and on click on the App.jsx file, the sourcemap is displayed.

It would be useful to be able to always (even if there is no error) view the 
sourcemap in dev mode with options like in webpack (eg: eval-source-map).
